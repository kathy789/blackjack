 *difference between my code and solution:
 *1) constructor and destructor. They have something and we do not. In destructor, Do not understand why it is no different with or without Clear()
 *2) Add() method: we forgot to check nullptr;
 *3) Clear method: After deleter the pointers, they set the pointer to null. (dereference it to 0) It is good practice to set dangling ptr to NUll.
 *4) GetTotal() method: the solution has more clear logic : add everything up and check whether we need treat Ace as 11.
